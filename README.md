# EuroTrip

Milestone Project 2 - Code Institute

This website was created as a platform for users to quickly see where they can go on holiday in Europe for their projected budget. The site incorporates a search bar where they can enter their budget and the list of affordable flight destinations pop up on the google map embedded in the page. They can hover over these destinations to see their cost and once they see their options they can then search for information about that particular place or things to do in it in the places API. It serves as a quick and easy way to find out where they can go and what they can do there for a certain amount. The Kayak API is then utilised so that the person can then proceed to book their entire holiday from here on once they have done their research on my website. There is also a trending section where the users can swift through different destinations if they are undecided on where to go.

#### Demo:

A live demo can be found here (insert link)

#### UX:

The main goal of the site is to offer a quick and simple way for a customer to decide where they want to go in Europe on a holiday break for their budget. The page is kept simple so as to not distract the customer too much from their task and hence incorporates a very sleek, neutral and professional design. 

The banner at the top is there to capture that initial sense of excitement of booking a holiday. This draws the customer in initially to the task at hand. The Navbar is a simple button to keep with the modern design and each section brings you to the relative section on the page, with a smooth scroll feature incorporated to keep the professional feel of the page. All sections of the page are easily accessible for the customer to navigate through them. They all give them options to search for places that might interest them with plenty of information at hand to make their decision. There is also a simple subscribe form at the bottom of the page for customers to keep up to date on holiday offers.

#### Features:

The navbar stays the same on this page to maintain the sheek professional feel to the website. Once the button is clicked there is a dropdown of the different sections which act as links to scroll you down to that part of the page. Once the section on the navbar is clicked that item is 'active' to denote to users what section they are currently on.

The search bar works in tandem with the maps as a means of easily seeing where they can go for theuir budget. The user inputs an amount into the bar and this then populates the map with destinations of where they can go.
